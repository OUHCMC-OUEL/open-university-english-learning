      "content": "The Amazon rainforest, often called the lungs of the Earth, is the largest tropical rainforest in the world. It stretches across nine countries in South America, covering more than 5.5 million square kilometers. The rainforest is home to a staggering diversity of plants and animals, including thousands of species yet to be discovered. The Amazon River, which flows through the forest, plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecosystem. Despite its ecological importance, human activities such as deforestation and agriculture have caused significant damage in recent decades."

Earth, the third planet from the Sun, supports diverse life forms thanks to its moderate climate and abundant water. Mars, often called the Red Planet, has fascinated scientists due to evidence that liquid water may have existed there in the past."
