The forest is home to millions of species of plants, animals, and insects. The Amazon River flows through the forest, providing essential water. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. Indigenous tribes live throughout the forest. Annual rainfall is very high. Deforestation is a major threat. The forest regulates Earth's climate. Many species remain undiscovered. Logging and agriculture impact the ecosystem. Rivers provide transportation routes. Soil is rich but fragile. The forest is vital for global ecological balance. Many medicinal plants are found here. Rivers support biodiversity. Forest fires threaten habitats. Conservation projects are ongoing. The forest maintains the water cycle. Many birds, mammals, and reptiles live in the Amazon."
